 * The same ceremony as the button, run without a press: the browser offers a
 * passkey it already holds as an autofill suggestion on the email field
 * (`autocomplete="username webauthn"` on the input), which is how a passkey
 * synced through iCloud Keychain or a password manager shows up on a device
 * that never enrolled one.
 *
 * supabase-js runs this ceremony only modally and keeps its serialisers
 * private, so this uses the two-step API with the WebAuthn Level 3 JSON
 * methods. A browser without those keeps the button and nothing else.
 *
 * Resolves to undefined on a session, the server's error when the owner picked
 * a passkey and verification refused it, or null when nothing happened: the
 * ceremony was aborted or failed in the browser, or the challenge could not be
 * fetched. Each load fetches one challenge; GoTrue expires it.
