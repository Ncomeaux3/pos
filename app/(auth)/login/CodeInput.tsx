/**
 * The code field. One input rather than a box per digit: boxes need focus
 * management, paste splitting and backspace handling to behave, a phone
 * keyboard fills a single field correctly without any of it, and a row of six
 * boxes is a build that has decided how long the code is.
 *
 * autoComplete one-time-code is what makes iOS offer the code above the
 * keyboard instead of making the owner switch to Mail and back.
 *
 * It does not submit itself. The first build submitted on the sixth digit,
 * which silently truncated the 8 digit code this project actually issues and
 * reported the owner's correct code as wrong. Submitting on a length this app
 * has guessed is the bug, so the owner presses the button and Supabase decides
 * whether the code is right.
