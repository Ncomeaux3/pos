 * decisions, the manual check-ins, the week note, and the review row. The
 * review row is written last on purpose, so a week that says it closed is one
 * whose other writes landed. Anything that did not land is named in the result
 * rather than swallowed, because a review that quietly half-applied is worse
 * than one that failed.
 *
 * No module is named here. Each one is handed back what the owner decided
 * about its own rows, so deleting a module removes its part of the close
 * rather than breaking it.
