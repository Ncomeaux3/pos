 * The way out. The app had none: there was no sign out anywhere in it until
 * 2026-09-14, which on a single owner install is easy to miss and impossible
 * to work around, and it made the passkey path untestable because testing it
 * starts by being signed out.
 *
 * A plain form and a server action, so it works before hydration and on a
 * phone that is struggling.
