        Each one is named after the browser that made it. A passkey kept in iCloud Keychain or a
        password manager follows the account, so it also signs in from the other devices that
        share it; the sign in page offers it in the email field. A passkey is bound to the domain
        it was created on. Moving Holon to another domain makes
        every passkey here unusable and each one has to be added again, so add them after the
        domain is settled. The email code is the way back in if a device is lost.
