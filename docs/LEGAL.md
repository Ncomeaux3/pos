# Legal and compliance register

What Holon's legal pages promise, what the code does to keep those promises, and what must happen before strangers can sign up. Written 2026-09-23 from the owner's answers (operator: Nick Comeaux as an individual; Alabama law; US only for now; free beta, paid plans later) and a sourced research pass. **This is not legal advice. Have a lawyer review the three documents before a public beta.**

The documents: `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/privacy/health` (public, `core/owner.ts` `isPublicPath`). Every fact they share (name, email, address, state, effective date) lives in `core/legal.ts`. Change the effective date there with any material edit, and give users the 30 days' notice both documents promise.

## Status

| Risk | Status | Evidence or next step |
|---|---|---|
| Google Fonts loaded from Google (Munich court, 2022, damages per visitor) | Clear | Geist is self-hosted with `next/font/local` in `app/layout.tsx`; no request to fonts.googleapis.com or fonts.gstatic.com anywhere. Keep it that way: no `next/font/google`, no font CDN link. |
| Global Privacy Control | Clear | The policy says an opt-out signal changes nothing because nothing is sold or shared; it does not claim to read the `Sec-GPC` header. If selling, sharing or ads ever start, honour the header first. |
| Session replay, analytics, ad pixels | Clear | None installed (no analytics, Sentry, PostHog, Hotjar, Clarity or GTM in `package.json` or the app). The Privacy Policy says so; adding any of them requires updating the policy first, and a consent banner for non-essential cookies. |
| Cookie banner | Not needed now | Only necessary cookies: the Supabase session, `pos_theme`, `pos_sidebar`, `pos_oauth_state_*` (10 minutes). A new cookie must be added to the policy's list. All listed in the Privacy Policy. UK PECR and EU ePrivacy exempt strictly necessary cookies. |
| Email with no unsubscribe or postal address (CAN-SPAM) | Clear for now | Every email today is transactional to the account holder (sign-in code, digest, alerts), which CAN-SPAM exempts. **Before any marketing or launch email:** a one-click unsubscribe, the postal address from `core/legal.ts` in the footer, and a true subject line. |
| Subscription with no renewal terms next to the button (California ARL as amended July 2025, ROSCA) | Written, not built | Terms section 10 commits to the disclosures. **Before charging:** show price, billing interval, auto-renewal and how to cancel next to the Subscribe button; an unticked consent checkbox; online cancellation in the same place; a renewal reminder email for annual plans; 30 days' notice to beta users. The FTC click-to-cancel rule was vacated in July 2025 and is back in rulemaking; recheck it then. |
| DMCA designated agent ($6) | **Owner action** | Terms section 11 names the agent. Register at the Copyright Office DMCA Designated Agent Directory (dmca.copyright.gov), $6, and renew every three years (verify the period when registering). Safe harbor needs the registration, not only the page. |
| No age question at signup (COPPA) | Written, not built | Terms require 18, or the age of majority where the user lives (19 in Alabama and Nebraska, 21 in Mississippi: verify with the lawyer). There is no signup yet (single owner). **Before a public signup:** an age confirmation checkbox, unticked, that blocks account creation. |
| Operator is an individual (no liability shield) | **Owner decision** | Recommended: form an LLC before the beta, update `core/legal.ts` `operator`, and get the lawyer to confirm the terms name it. |
| Mailing address | Clear | `core/legal.ts` `address`, shown on all three pages and used for DMCA notices. A PO box or virtual mailbox would keep a home address private if that is wanted later. |
| Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use) | Clear once #138 merges | The policy's Google sections say "if you connect", so they are true before the Google integration (PR #138) lands; they are published first because Google's consent screen needs the link. |
| Google API Services User Data Policy, detail | Clear | The exact disclosure sentence is in `/privacy`, on the app's own authorized domain. Google Calendar data is never sent to an AI provider (calendar events are not classified, embedded or summarized). Keep that true in Phase 7c: Gmail content sent to Haiku is a transfer to an AI model and must be disclosed and allowed under Limited Use before it ships. |
| Google verification over 100 users | Deferred | Unverified apps show a warning and cap at 100 users. `calendar.readonly` is a sensitive scope (brand verification); `gmail.readonly` in 7c is restricted and needs a paid security assessment (verify the current cost). Decide before the beta passes 100 users. |
| Washington My Health My Data Act (and Nevada, Connecticut) | Policy written | `/privacy/health` is the separate consumer health data policy, linked from sign-in and Settings. **Before a public signup:** link it from the public homepage, and collect a separate opt-in consent for health data beyond what a feature needs. No sharing without signed authorization. |
| EU and UK users (GDPR, UK GDPR) | Out of scope | Offered in the US only; both documents say so. **Before opening EU/UK:** an EU and a UK representative (Art. 27; the exemption likely fails because health data is core; roughly 200 to 2,400 a year each), explicit Art. 9 consent for health data, a DPIA, transfer terms with each provider, Art. 13 notice contents, and an arbitration carve-out for EU/UK consumers. |
| CCPA and CPRA | Not applicable | Thresholds (revenue over about $26.6M, or 100,000 California consumers, or half of revenue from selling data) are far above a beta. The policy gives everyone access, deletion and portability anyway. |
| Alabama Personal Data Protection Act | Not yet in force | Signed April 2026, effective May 1, 2027, thresholds 25,000 Alabama residents. Recheck before May 2027. |
| Breach notification | Promised | Alabama's Data Breach Notification Act and other states' laws. The policy promises notice without unreasonable delay. Keep a short incident note in docs/SETUP-SUPABASE.md when the beta opens. |
| Backup retention | **Manual step, automate before beta** | Database dumps in `pos-backups` are pruned at 30 days (`.github/workflows/backup.yml`, `find ... -mtime +30 -delete`), as the policy states. The storage mirror (uploaded files: insurance and health documents) is never pruned by design. The policy and the health policy promise to delete a file's backup copies within 30 days of a deletion request, which today means deleting them by hand from `pos-backups`. Before beta: a runbook or a script that removes a deleted account's or file's mirror copies. |
| Error reports | Clear | `core.client_errors` is pruned at 30 days nightly (`pruneClientErrors` in `core/jobs.ts`), as the policy states. The request log is pruned at 90 days. |
| Account export and deletion | Manual | The policy promises a copy and deletion within 30 days by email. Today that is done by hand from the database. **Before a public beta:** an Export and a Delete account button, or a written runbook. |
| Processor agreements | **Owner action** | Accept or download the data processing terms of Supabase, Vercel, Anthropic, Voyage AI, Resend and GitHub, and confirm each one's use of API data (for example, that Anthropic API inputs are not used for training). The Privacy Policy lists them and what each receives; any new provider must be added there first. |
| Multi-user | Not built | The app is single owner (SPEC principle 7). The Terms and policies are written for a multi-user beta so they need no rewrite, but accounts for other people do not exist yet. |
| Lawyer review | **Owner action** | Before a public beta. Bring this file and the three pages. |
