# Status

Where the build actually is. Updated at the end of each step. Read this first
in a fresh session, then `docs/plans/design-build.md` for what comes next.

Last updated: 2026-09-08, end of step 14. Branch `phase-1-core`.

## Done

**Phase 1 steps 1 to 11 of 16.** Steps 1 to 7 shipped 2026-09-05; the design
bundle landed 2026-09-07 and steps 0, 7.5 and 8 to 11 followed.

| Step | What exists |
|---|---|
| 1 to 7 | Scaffold, core migration, auth, crypto/settings/llm, module registry with the `notes` stub, entities/events/xp/classify, integration registry and Connections |
| 0 | Design bundle adopted as the screen spec, 17 decisions logged |
| 7.5 | ComeauxVerse brand layer: tokens, Manrope, type scale, radius, ~20 primitives in `components/pos/`, sidebar and mobile tab bar, login rebuilt |
| 8 | Hybrid search, Search page, command palette |
| 9 | Proposals, the guard, the Review screen, migration `core_platform` |
| 10 | Query tool, rate limiter, request log, storage buckets |
| 11 | MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp`, Settings Agents and MCP tab |
| 12 | Job runner, notifications, orchestrator, the Dashboard bento. The nightly run works end to end and sends one email |
| 13 | `pnpm setup` and `pnpm setup:demo`, both idempotent |
| 14 | CI and backup workflows, restore drilled |

## Verification

```
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test    # 253 tests, 24 files
pnpm test:e2e                               # 31 specs, 1440px and 402px, both themes
pnpm setup:demo                             # idempotent bootstrap
```

Screenshots land in `e2e/__screens__/` (gitignored). Tests use their own
`pos_test` database, rebuilt from migrations by a vitest globalSetup;
`core/db.ts` refuses any other database while `VITEST` is set.

## Live and connected

Anthropic, Resend and Voyage are all connected in `core.connections`. The full
pipeline is verified against real providers: entities embed through Voyage,
classification splits between keyword rules and `claude-haiku-4-5`, and
`core.llm_calls` records the spend the soft cap depends on.

## Screens built

Login, Dashboard (live, with the bento tiles), Notes, Search, Review, Settings
General, Settings Connections, Settings Agents and MCP. Command palette on Cmd K.

Not yet built: the real Dashboard tiles, Notifications, Agent Log, Onboarding,
Weekly Review, and every module beyond the `notes` stub.

## Next: step 15, deploy

Vercel, a hosted Supabase project, and the first real nightly run in
production. Everything it needs from the owner is in docs/OWNER-TODO.md.

Then step 16: update the module README and connections.md, run /review, merge
to main. After that, Phase 2: Skill Tree, then Tasks and Goals, then Finance.

The registry cycle that blocked steps 12 and 13 is fixed: both registries load
in a plain Node process, which is what lets `pnpm setup` and the cron job work
outside Next.

## Open questions for the owner

- Voyage is capped at 3 requests a minute without a payment method. Search is
  built around it (words first, meaning only when words find nothing, two of
  eight queries spend a request) so it is not urgent.
- `docs/OWNER-TODO.md` holds the rest, including what step 14 and 15 need.

## Rules learned the hard way

- **`supabase db reset` destroys local data**, including every provider key.
  Use `supabase migration up`. Written into CLAUDE.md.
- **A client component must not import from a module that reaches `pg` or the
  module registry.** Turbopack reports it as a missing build manifest, not an
  import error. Vocabulary a client needs lives in a leaf module with no
  imports: `core/owner.ts`, `core/autonomy.ts`.
- **New core tables need their own trigger, RLS, both policies and three
  grants.** `core_init` does that in a loop over `pg_tables` that does not
  re-run for a later migration.
