// v1.2 phase 5c. The one place that answers which rows a rule touches.
//
// Before this file a rule only ever decided what the next sync would do, so a
// rule written today said nothing about the 607 rows already in the ledger and
// a wrong rule was unreachable. Writing, editing or deleting one now re-files
// the history it matches, and that is the only way the backlog clears.
//
// Two invariants hold everywhere below. A row with `is_manual = true` is never
// written: the owner's correction is the fact no job may overwrite. And a
// re-file runs the *whole* ranked rule set over a row rather than forcing the
// one rule that occasioned it, so a short new rule cannot steal a row a longer
// one owns and deleting one rule hands its rows to whatever matches next
// instead of orphaning them.
