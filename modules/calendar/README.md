# Calendar

One calendar of everything dated in POS, and a home for events that have no
other module. v1.2 phase 6a.

## The rows are the other modules'

Almost nothing on this screen is stored here. Tasks, Goals, Travel, Insurance,
Home, Health, Meals, Finance and Fitness each answer the manifest's
`calendar(range)` seam with their own dated rows, and
`core/calendar-registry.ts` puts them together. The Calendar reads no module
schema, the same split as the Weekly Review's `review` seam. A module that is
deleted drops off the screen and nothing here changes.

What each module sends is in its own `calendar.ts`, with a test beside it:

| Module | On the calendar | Links to |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks | due date, with its time; done ones muted | the task's drawer |
| Goals | deadline | Goals |
| Travel | each day of a trip, and itinerary items on their day | the trip |
| Insurance | the day an active policy expires | the policy |
| Home | service due dates, projected forward by the interval | the asset |
| Health | appointments with their time, medication refill dates | Health |
| Meals | plan entries, labelled by slot | Meals |
| Finance | recurring charges, projected forward by cadence | Subscriptions |
| Fitness | logged workouts, as done | Fitness |

Links to a module root become drawer links in v1.2 Phase 13.

## What this module stores

`calendar.event` holds events typed here (`source = 'manual'`, or `agent`
through MCP) and, from Phases 7a and 7b, read-only events from Google and
iCloud (`google`, `ics`), upserted on `(source, external_id)`. Only a typed
event can be edited or deleted; a feed's rows are the feed's, and the next
pull would overwrite an edit.

Google (Phase 7a) arrives through the `pull_google` job: a full window each
run, 30 days back to 365 ahead, from the calendars picked on the Google card in
Settings > Connections. The Sync band shows on this screen once Google is
connected; the module has no `requires`, because without Google it is still
complete from the other modules. Setup: docs/SETUP-INTEGRATIONS.md, Google.

Times are the owner's wall clock and are turned into instants in SQL in the
owner's zone, so the server's zone (UTC on Vercel) never enters it.

`calendar.settings` is one row holding the modules the owner switched off with
the chips. It follows the owner between phone and desktop.

Events are not registered in `core.entities`: `register()` classifies every row
to skills, and a feed's hundreds of meetings would each take a classifier pass
for nothing an appointment could earn.

## Tools

- `get_digest`: counts for today and tomorrow and the next three things, across
  every module the owner has not switched off.
- `write_event`, `delete_event`: typed events only.
- `set_hidden`: the modules the screen leaves out.
