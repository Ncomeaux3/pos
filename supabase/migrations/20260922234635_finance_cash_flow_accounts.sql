-- finance-charts phase 1. Which accounts are cash flow is the owner's call.
--
-- cashFlowByMonth summed every account, and an uncategorised row is read by
-- its sign, so a retirement contribution read as income and a brokerage buy as
-- spending. A kind rule cannot settle it: the owner's `other` accounts hold
-- $211,951 of what are probably holdings, and only the owner knows. So the
-- switch is per account, set in a drawer beside the chart.
--
-- Investments and `other` start off. A wrong "off" shows in the card head's
-- count; a wrong "on" overstates spending silently. The sync job sets the same
-- default from the kind on insert, because a column default cannot vary by it.
